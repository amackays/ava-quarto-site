I’m a fourth-year Ph.D. student at Duke University’s Program in Genetics and Genomics working with Dr. Greg Wray.\nI’m passionate about explaining the origin and maintenance of diversity in the natural world, using an ever-changing toolkit of genetic and epigenetic tools. To do this well, I am becoming increasingly interested in how we wrangle and visualize big datasets, and am particularly excited about how graphic and design choices can help us communicate genetics more effectively, to other academics as well as the public."

Nature Methods 21, 3  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-024-02216-7.\n\n\n The ENCODE Consortium’s efforts to annotate noncoding cis-regulatory elements (CREs) have advanced our understanding of gene regulatory landscapes. Pooled, noncoding CRISPR screens offer a systematic approach to investigate cis-regulatory mechanisms. The ENCODE4 Functional Characterization Centers conducted 108 screens in human cell lines, comprising &gt;540,000 perturbations across 24.85 megabases of the genome. Using 332 functionally confirmed CRE–gene links in K562 cells, we established guidelines for screening endogenous noncoding elements with CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), including accurate detection of CREs that exhibit variable, often low, transcriptional effects. Benchmarking five screen analysis tools, we find that CASA produces the most conservative CRE calls and is robust to artifacts of low-specificity single guide RNAs. We uncover a subtle DNA strand bias for CRISPRi in transcribed regions with implications for screen design and analysis. Together, we provide an accessible data resource, predesigned single guide RNAs for targeting 3,275,697 ENCODE SCREEN candidate CREs with CRISPRi and screening guidelines to accelerate functional characterization of the noncoding genome."

    "text": "Mackay-Smith A, Wray GA (2025) Genome Mountaineering: Expanding Horizons of the 3D Genome for the Intrepid Evolutionary Adventurer. Genome Biology and Evolution 17 (6): evaf113  https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evaf113.\n\n\n The physical positioning of DNA in 3D space within the nucleus can be important for understanding how genetic changes influence gene regulation and consequently phenotype. The costs of 3D genomic assays are falling, concomitant with the rapid innovation of newer, more customizable methods. Thus, evolutionary researchers are increasingly able to engage with these approaches as barriers diminish. As we apply these methods to a broader range of organisms, we learn more about principles governing genome structure and regulatory evolution in 3D space. Here, we use recent studies in primarily nonmodel organisms to illustrate how these approaches can provide novel insights into evolutionary processes. We focus on these cases as motivation for further research into evolutionary conservation and change in 3D organization; the relationship between 3D organization and structural changes in the genome; and the impact of 3D organization in the evolution of gene regulation and organismal traits. We argue that 3D genomic information can help resolve a wide range of outstanding questions in evolutionary biology, particularly as technologies improve and become more accessible in nonmodel systems."

    "text": "Mackay-Smith A, Dornon MK, Lucier R, Okimoto A, Mendonca de Sousa F, Rodriguero M, Confalonieri V, Lanteri AA, Sequeira AS (2021) Host-specific gene expression as a tool for introduction success in Naupactus parthenogenetic weevils. PLoS ONE 16(7): e0248202  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248202.\n\n\n Food resource access can mediate establishment success in invasive species, and generalist herbivorous insects are thought to rely on mechanisms of transcriptional plasticity to respond to dietary variation. While asexually reproducing invasives typically have low genetic variation, the twofold reproductive capacity of asexual organisms is a marked advantage for colonization. We studied host-related transcriptional acclimation in parthenogenetic, invasive, and polyphagous weevils: Naupactus cervinus and N. leucoloma. We analyzed patterns of gene expression in three gene categories that can mediate weevil-host plant interactions through identification of suitable host plants, short-term acclimation to host plant defenses, and long-term adaptation to host plant defenses and their pathogens. This approach employed comparative transcriptomic methods to investigate differentially expressed host detection, detoxification, immune defense genes, and pathway-level gene set enrichment. Our results show that weevil gene expression responses can be host plant-specific, and that elements of that response can be maintained in the offspring. Some host plant groups, such as legumes, appear to be more taxing as they elicit a complex gene expression response which is both strong in intensity and specific in identity. However, the weevil response to taxing host plants shares many differentially expressed genes with other stressful situations, such as host plant cultivation conditions and transition to novel host, suggesting that there is an evolutionarily favorable shared gene expression regime for responding to different types of stressful situations. Modulating gene expression in the absence of other avenues for phenotypic adaptation may be an important mechanism of successful colonization for these introduced insects."

    "text": "Teaching Philosophy\nI model learning as a process that my students are experiencing inside and outside of the classroom: I am a contributor to that process while they are in the laboratory or lecture hall, and that learning does and should contribute beyond those bounds. Approaching the learning process in this way, I view my job as encouraging the continuation of “learning to learn”.\nThe first way I encourage practicing to learn is by ensuring that students have the vocabulary with which to approach and take ownership of their learning. Throughout a typical semester-long course, I hold a series of ‘mini-workshops’ during class time where we take a break from our normal learning structure to discuss topics such as diverse learning styles, strategies for approaching assignments aligned with your learning style, interpreting learning goals from the instructional team, and defining attainable personal learning goals. Outside of these soft skills workshops, during the bulk of the curriculum I ask students to assess their success themselves with structured rubrics. Students self-identify knowledge gaps they want to have filled, which I then weight against the material that needs to be covered in the class. By discussing their rubrics with me, they can gain a sense of how much mastery they personally feel they have, versus where I observe them to be. This strategy encourages students to take ownership of their learning process in my class and, ideally, in others.\nFurthering the objective of practicing learning, I also incorporate frequent, low-stakes formative assessment geared towards removing student fear or pressure around grading. Using regular, low-value assignments with multimodal completion options (written, diagrammatic, etc.) lets students experiment with their learning styles without fear of major failure. I also use informal research presentations in small groups and repeated discussions/feedback sessions for scientific paper drafts, to reduce student apprehension about presenting final products and encourage communication between peers. It can be life-changing for a student to realize that they are not the only ones struggling, or that they have valuable knowledge to share with classmates. Finally, I use student self-reported success rubrics in tandem with my own observations to evaluate students with an ‘effort grade’, giving feedback on the effort that they are feeling they are exerting in the class against their grade performance. By returning students both a numeric grade as well as an ‘effort grade’ (exceeds, meets, or does not meet expectations) for class effort, I can let students know that even if they are struggling, I see and value their intentions.\nThird, I facilitate practicing to learn by demonstrating that practice in myself as the instructor. I emphasize student voices being listened to, rapport, and a holistic approach to both the instructor and student as dynamic people to result in the classroom being a safe space for students to practice learning in science. I do this via soliciting regular feedback on assignments, lectures, and classroom environment from my students via routine anonymized surveys. I set aside class time to discuss those results periodically with my students to foster a sense of community where I value their thoughts and feelings in the classroom, being wrong is okay, and material can be adjusted based on interest/difficulty and collaborative goalsetting. This practice establishes an image of the instructor as a human capable of making mistakes and with human limitations, which I leverage to deconstruct the common student preconception that science is intimidating and inaccessible. \nIn sum, I aim to have students leave my instruction with persistent interest and curiosity in the world around us; a focus on positive, meaningful growth as an independent learner; and comfort in evaluation as a learning tool rather than a barrier to be crossed.\n\n\nTeaching Experience\nAlthough my Ph.D. research is centered in evolutionary and molecular genetics, my teaching portfolio has a wide range. As an educator, my areas of expertise include broad topics in biology, evolutionary genetics, and data science/visualization. This makes me an appropriate fit for courses such as introductory cell and molecular biology, ecology and evolutionary biology, microbiology, upper-level seminars on evolution and genetics, and introductory/intermediate courses on data visualization.\nTo develop my instructional portfolio, I pursued formal instruction in teaching and pedagogy through Duke University’s Certificate in College Teaching program. Through this program, I completed coursework in the principles and methods of teaching (GS750: Fundamentals of College Teaching) as well as discipline-specific coursework tailored to the instruction of biology (BIO705S: Teaching Biology: Theory and Practice). Although my Ph.D. program in UPGG does not require Ph.D. students to teach, I sought out further teaching opportunities in order to implement and practice my repertoire of teaching skills.\nIn the spring semester of 2025, I took on the role of Teaching Assistant in the Biology department’s introductory microbiology course (BIO212L: General Microbiology). I was responsible for the semester-long instruction and oversight of a 13-person undergraduate laboratory section, meeting twice a week to work through wet-lab bench experiments and projects. My role involved acting as the leader of the laboratory section by managing student questions and concerns related to laboratory protocols and the day’s tasks on the fly, guiding students through a semester-long microbial identification project, ensuring safety compliance in a BSL-2 lab setting, grading laboratory notebooks, and proctoring their practical examinations. The format of this course was pre-structured around specific exercises and learning goals, for which I structured daily short introductory lectures for context and deeper understanding. For this classroom of predominantly premedical, grade-motivated students, I focused on encouraging critical thinking about their experimental outcomes via one-on-one discussions throughout the laboratory period. This teaching environment honed my skills in maintaining a safe and controlled classroom environment while also focusing on building rapport and content engagement among a group of highly motivated students. As my training is primarily in genetics, this teaching opportunity also encouraged me to practice instruction outside of my area of expertise. \nDuring my teaching of General Microbiology, I also participated in a semester-long practicum through the CCT program (GS798: Teaching Triangles: College Teaching Practicum & Observation). During this practicum, I worked with Teaching Assistants from other disciplines to provide reciprocal feedback on our instructional methods by sitting in on multiple classes. As a result of this cross-discipline peer feedback, I began incorporating teaching activities from other diverse classrooms into my curriculum, including adjusting my informal assessments to be more equitable for different learning styles and micro-agenda check-ins during lectures to ensure effective usage of class time."

My research interests revolve around evolutionary questions in the natural world, leveraging functional genomics methods to understand organismal adaptation and variation. To this end, my current work seeks to understand how epigenomic and structural factors interact to affect population genetics of hybridizing species in the diverse clade of Heliconius butterflies, in collaboration with teams at George Washington University and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. I am also funded by a James B. Duke Fellowship and the National Science Foundation’s Graduate Research Fellowship.\nI completed her undergraduate studies at Wellesley College, where I wrote an honors thesis in Dr. Andrea Sequeira’s lab on the transcriptomic responses and adaptation in an invasive, asexual beetle species. After leaving Wellesley, I moved to Dr. Pardis Sabeti’s lab at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT under the mentorship of Dr. Steve Reilly, working on human functional genomic characterization with the ENCODE Consortium. I then became the lab manager for the newly minted Reilly lab as it opened its doors at Yale in the fall of 2021. My work at Yale focused on the functional characterization of positively selected human variants, especially those within genetic regulatory elements, as well as consciously building the framework for an inclusive lab environment as the Reilly lab’s first member.\nAt Duke, I am involved in science communication and outreach programs such as the Carolinas Butterfly Monitoring Program and the Science Research and Education Network (SciREN). I am also a member of the Society of Duke Fellows.

Science 380, 6643 https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abn2253.\n\n\n Conserved genomic sequences disrupted in humans may underlie uniquely human phenotypic traits. We identified and characterized 10,032 human-specific conserved deletions (hCONDELs). These short (average 2.56 base pairs) deletions are enriched for human brain functions across genetic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic datasets. Using massively parallel reporter assays in six cell types, we discovered 800 hCONDELs conferring significant differences in regulatory activity, half of which enhance rather than disrupt regulatory function. We highlight several hCONDELs with putative human-specific effects on brain development, including HDAC5, CPEB4, and PPP2CA. Reverting an hCONDEL to the ancestral sequence alters the expression of LOXL2 and developmental genes involved in myelination and synaptic function. Our data provide a rich resource to investigate the evolutionary mechanisms driving new traits in humans and other species."

Insects 14, 113  https://doi.org/10.3390/insects14020113.\n\n\n The Fuller’s rose weevil Naupactus cervinus has become a globally invasive pest of several ornamental plants and fruit trees. This weevil has caused severe economic losses, and eggs laid on fruit are a quarantine barrier for several countries’ exports of fruit to markets in East Asia. Previous studies revealed that a genotype with high colonization ability successfully expanded throughout most continents, even in areas of inadequate environmental conditions, where this insect performs unexpectedly well, and that parthenogenesis may have helped to expand its geographic range. Pre-existing variation might have been eroded either by natural selection, leading to fixation of this variant able to cope with different environmental conditions to those in the native range, or by repeated bottlenecks during the process of invasion. To better understand the ecology of this invasive pest, we enlarged the sampling in areas of introduction, such as the southern United States, and surveyed genetic variation through mitochondrial and nuclear sequences in 13 localities across three states. Our results indicate that the invader genotype, already identified, has also colonized the continental United States (US), supporting the hypothesis of a general-purpose genotype capable of coping with adverse conditions and enlarging its geographical range. Parthenogenesis, and its associated lack of recombination, may help in maintaining a general-purpose genotype that facilitates the colonization of distant, unsuitable areas. However, demographic advantages linked to parthenogenesis as the sole mode of reproduction are also possible."

We developed hybridization chain reaction fluorescence in situ hybridization coupled with flow cytometry (HCR–FlowFISH), a broadly applicable approach to characterize CRISPR-perturbed CREs via accurate quantification of native transcripts, alongside CRISPR activity screen analysis (CASA), a hierarchical Bayesian model to quantify CRE activity. Across &gt;325,000 perturbations, we provide evidence that CREs can regulate multiple genes, skip over the nearest gene and display activating and/or silencing effects. At the cholesterol-level-associated FADS locus, we combine endogenous screens with reporter assays to exhaustively characterize multiple genome-wide association signals, functionally nominate causal variants and, importantly, identify their target genes."

    "text": "Throughout my academic career so far, I’ve benefited from having access to others’ successful writing examples and from their knowledge of the academic systems I’m engaging with. In the same vein, below are a few of the materials I’ve used to apply for lab technician positions, Ph.D programs, and fellowships. Please return the favor of my volunteering these resources by respecting my intellectual property and practicing academic integrity, and please please feel free to reach out with any questions!\n\nPh.D. Program Applications\nI applied to six programs in the fall of 2021: Duke - UPGG, Yale University - BBS (MCGD), UC-Berkeley - MCB (GGD), Stanford - Genetics, Cornell - MCGD (GGD), and UChicago - Ecology and Evolution. I was accepted into all of these programs, and below are links to my Duke Statement of Purpose (where I ended up matriculating), as well as to my UC-Berkeley essays (this is the only school on this list that is a little different, in that it requires a personal statement and a research statement).\nDuke SoP | UC-Berkeley Research Statement | UC-Berkeley Personal Statement\nIf you’re interested in Duke’s UPGG program, feel free to reach out!\n\n\nNSF GRFP Applications\nBelow are my research and personal statements for the NSF GRFP. I won this fellowship as I was applying to grad school, sending in an application in Fall 2021. I just want to acknowledge that this particular fellowship is known to be a bit of a lottery, so please keep that in mind when reading these and also when applying yourself! Even if you aren’t awarded the fellowship the first time around, you receive feedback on your submission, which is really useful for resubmission (and something I didn’t know when I applied).\nThere are some really useful resources from other graduate students on the internet! I highly recommend Alex Lang’s website - check out the database of many other students who have shared their (both successful and unsuccessful) proposals.\nNSF GRFP Research Statement | NSF GRFP Personal Statement\n\n\nSmall Grants\nTo make things easier on my end, I’m not going to post the variety of small grants I’ve applied for, but if you’re interested in Sigma Xi, small internal Grants-in-Aid, or Conference Travel Grants and you’d like to see my writing, drop me a line!\n\n\nC.V.\nI built my CV in LaTeX using the resume.cls class from Trey Hunner on GitHub. I used this same format while applying to teching jobs in academia after graduating from college.\nAva’s CV\n\n\nBuilding a Website\nIf you’re interested in starting a website, I really recommend hosting your site with GitHub and using Wowchemy/Netlify or Quarto for a quick and streamlined website template! Here’s a good tutorial that I used. GitHub website deployment is pretty easy with their walkthrough guides.\n\n\nWorking as a Tech\nWhile I was a tech for two years and I would highly recommend doing this for anyone applying to graduate school in genetics/genomics/evolution, I will just disclaimer this by saying that it’s really hard! Not only once you become a tech, but also while you’re applying to be one - I sent out over forty applications (albeit mostly due to the pandemic) and nearly ended up volunteering on a remote island outside Hawai’i instead of working at the Broad.\nIf you do land a tech job, and you feel like you’re struggling - I can guarantee you that other techs are feeling the same way around you (maybe in a different lab, or maybe even at a different institution but in a similar role). Being an early career researcher means that you are often more vulnerable than other researchers to imposter syndrome and intentional/inadvertent workplace forces: you may not have had work experience in research before and are unsure what is the norm vs. what is unhealthy, and the pressure of needing positive recommendations from your superiors to apply to grad school can lead to situations where work-life boundaries are blurred and/or you’re not sure how and when to advocate for yourself. I really really recommend seeking out other techs if you feel this way to figure out if the problem is with you or with a lab/mentor that is asking too much of you, has an unhealthy culture, etc.! And again, feel free to reach out :)\nIf you’re teching now and struggle with taking your failures too personally (to the point that it’s affecting your ability to work well on other things), something I did was keep a mistake log - write down what the mistake you’re having trouble letting go was; why it happened; and how you’re going to prevent it next time. I kept this on a google doc and every time I wrote a new entry, I sent it to my supervisor as well (after letting them know in person that I made an error), to let them know how I was planning on dealing with the setback. The act of owning the mistake and physically writing an action plan really helped me deal with, and move past, whatever the mistake was - big or small.\n\n\nReality Check!\nIn science, I sometimes feel like we spend a lot of time competing about achievements and the things that make us look smart! That’s great, especially when we celebrate each other for our achievements and the barriers we’ve overcome to get there, but it can also be isolating - when we focus only on the experiments that worked or the fellowships that were won, etc., it hides exactly how many failures (and how learning from those failures) built that amazing person who’s doing that science. Consequently, when you experience that failure yourself but nobody is discussing their own similar experiences, it can sometimes end up feeling like you are the only one who’s struggling or experiencing failure when trying to move through some parts of academia/science. So here are some things that didn’t work for me!\n\nIn graduate school, I was a Sigma Xi member and kept applying for their grants-in-aid. Ask me about the second time my proposal was rejected, with the only reviewer feedback provided as ‘nice grant.’!\nI applied for the Fulbright fellowship to do a science project in Sweden during my undergrad, in 2019. It was the first fellowship I applied to, and I tanked it HARD. I had no experience writing fellowship applications and didn’t get it.\nI graduated into the pandemic, in May 2020 - because of this, NOBODY was hiring. Although it looks awesome that I teched at the Broad, and I loved my time there, it was also probably the second place out of 40+ applications that even gave me an interview. That’s 38+ “No”s.\nI didn’t get into my first choice school for undergrad, and if it wasn’t for the science at Wellesley, I would have had a really bad time! I’m so thankful for the lifelong mentors and research experience I gained from Wellesley, but it was also one of the only places that actually accepted me.\n\nI deal with mistakes and failures in a way that one mentor put like this: imperfect, impersonal, impermanent. the process, AND you, are imperfect (human error); sometimes the decisions, or what went wrong, is impersonal - isn’t about you; and whatever the mistake or failure, it will pass - it is impermanent."
