##### Ph.D. Candidate, Evolution of Gene Regulation and Variation at Duke University

---

Thanks for stopping by! I’m a fourth-year Ph.D. student at Duke University's Program in Genetics and Genomics working with Dr. Greg Wray.

I’m passionate about **explaining the origin and maintenance of diversity in the natural world**, using an ever-changing toolkit of **genetic and epigenetic tools**. To do this well, I am becoming increasingly interested in how we wrangle and visualize big datasets, and am particularly excited about **how graphic and design choices can help us communicate genetics more effectively**, to other academics as well as the public.
